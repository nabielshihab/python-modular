We use modules to break down large programs into manageable and organized small files. It is better to define the functions that we use frequently into a module and call them when needed in many other programs, than to define or copy-paste these functions into many programs."

In the library there must be a `__init__.py` module (an empty module without any definition or statement) so that the modules in the library can be used in several programs in the working directory.\n",

    "> 1. **Mag_of_completeness.py** module, this module contains functions of several estimation methods of magnitude of completeness (Mc) and maximum magnitude for b-value calculations. In addition, this module also contains a function to form a frequency-magnitude distribution. The functions in it are:\n",

    "    6. fmd_bvalue\n",
    "    7. fmd_details\n",
    "> 2. **Curve_fitting_method.py** module, this module contains the functions of several *curve fitting* methods for estimating *b-value*, its uncertainty, and also 95% confidence interval. The functions in it are:\n",

    "    3. plot_noncum_fmd\n",

    "These modules will be imported into the `autobvalue` and `selected_autobvalue` programs. both python notebook (.ipynb) and python (.py) file can import modules."
